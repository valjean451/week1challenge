# Week 1 Challenge - Code Refactor

## Description

The task for this week's challenge was to refactor the HTML and CSS of a previously-built website. 'Refactoring' is the process of taking existing code and improving it's structure, organization, and accessibility, without altering it's function, and it can play an important part of code maintenance by helping keep resources clean and up-to-date.

I learned a great deal about CSS organization in this project, but I think the overarching theme for me is that there are myriad ways to accomplish any given task in web design, and that often there isn't a "right" way to do things. This makes refactoring even more important--the person refactoring may know a more efficient way to do something, and that reciprocal communication plays an important part of the web design process, I would imagine.

## Credits

I worked on this challenge solo. That said, I do want to shout out my classmate Colton Mortensen, who has been great to work with in the breakout rooms on the more complicated CSS concepts. 

I used several third-party instructional resources to complete this project:
[HTML Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
[HTML Headings](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp)
[CSS Organization Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Organizing)
[Youtube video on Alt/Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka1qNLalRxM) - Was very helpful in explaining the philosophy behind alt text
[Professional Readme template](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)
And many many MDN reference pages.
